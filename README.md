# Credit Card Fraud Detection

## 📌 Project Description
This project aims to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using **Machine Learning**.  
I have worked with a dataset containing anonymized transaction details where the target column (`Class`) indicates whether a transaction is **valid (0)** or **fraudulent (1)**.  

The project steps I implemented are:
1. **Data Loading & Exploration**  
   - Loaded the dataset and explored basic statistics.  
   - Checked imbalance between fraudulent and valid transactions.  
   - Analyzed transaction amounts for both classes.  

2. **Data Visualization**  
   - Plotted a correlation heatmap to understand relationships among features.  

3. **Data Preparation**  
   - Split the dataset into **training** and **testing** sets.  

4. **Model Building**  
   - Trained a **Random Forest Classifier** on the training data.  
   - Made predictions on the test set.  

5. **Evaluation**  
   - Evaluated model performance on detecting fraudulent transactions.  

Overall, the notebook demonstrates how a supervised learning model like Random Forest can be applied to **fraud detection problems**.
