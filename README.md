# 💳 Credit Card Fraud Detection

## 📌 Project Overview
This project aims to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using **Machine Learning**.  
It involves data analysis, visualization, model training, and evaluation to classify transactions as **legitimate (0)** or **fraudulent (1)**.

The dataset contains anonymized transaction details to protect user confidentiality.  
This project demonstrates the use of supervised learning techniques for fraud detection.

## 🧩 Key Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, feature scaling, and data balancing.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Distribution plots and correlation checks to understand data patterns.  
- **Model Training:** Implemented multiple ML models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree).  
- **Performance Evaluation:** Compared models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.  
- **Visualization:** Displayed class imbalance and confusion matrix using Seaborn and Matplotlib.
